-- ============================================================
-- 018_account_member_rpcs.sql — RPCs for member management
--
-- Why RPCs and not direct UPDATEs from the client
--
--   The `profiles_update` RLS policy from migration 017 only
--   allows a user to update their *own* profile row. That is
--   correct for self-service edits (name, avatar) but it would
--   block an admin from changing a teammate's role or moving
--   a removed member to a fresh personal account.
--
--   These three SECURITY DEFINER functions are the supervised
--   escape hatches: they bypass RLS to do exactly the writes the
--   matching API route needs, but every function self-checks the
--   caller's authority via `NULL /* was auth.uid() — enforce in app */` first, so the privilege
--   bypass is scoped tightly.
--
-- Error contract
--
--   All functions raise Postgres exceptions with these SQLSTATEs:
--     42501 ("insufficient_privilege") — forbidden
--     22023 ("invalid_parameter_value") — bad input / 400
--   The `toErrorResponse` helper on the API side maps each to
--   the right HTTP status, with the RAISE message surfaced to
--   the caller.
--
-- Idempotent — safe to run multiple times.

-- set_member_role(p_user_id, p_new_role)

-- Admin+ changes another member's role within the caller's
-- account. Cannot promote to / demote from 'owner' (that is the
-- transfer endpoint). Cannot target self.
